			    <div class="row">
  
						<div class="column "><img class="collapsible" src="images/aries.jpg" alt="Aries"/>
							   <div class="content">
								  <p><b>DEC 21, 2019:</b> Be careful not to react too soon to someone's urgent cries for help today. 
								  Chances are, this is a textbook case of crying wolf—or this person may have a very distorted sense 
								  of what 'urgent' really means. Either way, he or she wants attention but doesn't really need help, 
								  and you don't have time to deal with this sort of immaturity right now. Let the drama distract someone else.
								  You have real obligations and responsibilities to take care of.
								  </p>
								</div>
						</div>
						<div class="column "><img class="collapsible" src="images/taurus.jpg" alt="Taurus"/>
							   <div class="content">
								  <p><b>DEC 21, 2019:</b>  An innocent comment that someone makes may irk you—but keep 
								  in mind that this person is just trying to help. Of course, this kind of help is the last thing you need!
								  If you aren't ready to hear other people's versions of the truth, let them know (in no uncertain terms).
								  Your ego is exceptionally sensitive lately, partially due to a power struggle that you lost. 
								  If you take some time to lick your wounds, you will be back on track and feeling confident soon.
								  </p>
								</div>
						</div>
						<div class="column "><img class="collapsible" src="images/gemini.jpg" alt="Gemin"/>
							   <div class="content">
								  <p><b>DEC 21, 2019:</b> Today, try to get involved in a fun debate or at least eavesdrop on a 
								  titillating conversation. You should definitely not go around looking for a fight, but it wouldn't be a bad 
								  idea to step out of your comfort zone and experience a little bit of conflict right now. 
								  It will strengthen some of your beliefs, challenge other beliefs, and give you some new ideas. 
								  You can handle a lot of different opinions right now, and you will enjoy hearing what other people say.
								  </p>
								</div>
						</div>
						<div class="column "><img class="collapsible" src="images/cancer.jpg" alt="Cancer"/>
							   <div class="content">
								  <p><b>DEC 21, 2019:</b> You'll be the recipient of an extravagant gift today, but it won't come wrapped in pretty paper.
								  Someone will give you the gift of understanding something new. 
								  You're developing a significant appreciation for the subtle connections people can make—even two strangers can look each 
								  other in the eye and suddenly understand each other. A seemingly simple conversation will plant an idea in your head that
								  you'll be tossing around for days.
								  </p>
								</div>
						</div>
						<div class="column "><img class="collapsible" src="images/leo.jpg" alt="Leo"/>
							   <div class="content">
								  <p><b>DEC 21, 2019:</b> You may have your eyes on the prize today—but is this prize the right prize to be focusing on?
								  You will have no trouble achieving what you set out to do right now, so don't be too conservative in your goals.
								  Aim high and really challenge yourself—the stars are encouraging you to put it all on the line and give yourself a task
								  that's way outside your comfort zone. A little bit of fear is even a good thing—it'll help motivate you.
								  </p>
								</div>
						</div>
						<div class="column "><img class="collapsible" src="images/virgo.jpg" alt="Virgo"/>
							   <div class="content">
								  <p><b>DEC 21, 2019:</b> When things are not going exactly the way you want them to, it's good for you to be flexible. 
								  But you also have to know when to stand your ground and not give in—not even an inch. Today, speak up if you just can't 
								  go along with what everyone else is saying or doing. Sometimes the only way to get people to listen to you and respect 
								  what you say is to force them to. A quiet word to the right person will get you all the satisfaction you need.
								  </p>
								</div>
						</div>
						<div class="column "><img class="collapsible" src="images/libra.jpg" alt="Libra"/>
							   <div class="content">
								  <p><b>DEC 21, 2019:</b> Whenever you're in doubt about how to act today, just talk! 
								  Your way with words will turn the key and unlock many exciting new opportunities—especially 
								  if you are in a group situation. It's time for you to take a bigger leadership role with your people,
								  and your attitude will be the perfect thing to motivate people who aren't usually 'team players' or cheerful participants.
								  You will be able to lighten the mood and impress some important people.
								  </p>
								</div>
						</div>
						<div class="column "><img class="collapsible" src="images/scorpio.jpg" alt="Scorpio"/>
							   <div class="content">
								  <p><b>DEC 21, 2019:</b> Coasting through life can be a lot of fun, but it won't get you too excited today.
								  What you need right now is a real challenge—something that tests your abilities and enables you to prove to
								  the people around you that you are worthy of high praise. It's rock-star time! You are learning that when a
								  goal is too easy to attain, it is not very fulfilling. Find the more difficult route today and take it. You'll end up in an amazing place.
								  </p>
								</div>
						</div>
						<div class="column "><img class="collapsible" src="images/sagittarius.jpg" alt="Sagittarius"/>
							   <div class="content">
								  <p><b>DEC 21, 2019:</b>The bold risk-taker deep inside of you is eager to take this chance you have been given—it's fully confident that all will
								  go well and that you will succeed. But is gambling really something that you feel comfortable with doing right now? 
								  Do not do something just for the sake of doing something. Make sure that it is the right thing to do and that it will 
								  take you where you want to go. You have to make sure your heart is ready to take this giant leap forward, too.
								  </p>
								</div>
						</div>
						<div class="column "><img class="collapsible" src="images/capricorn.jpg" alt="Capricorn"/>
							   <div class="content">
								  <p><b>DEC 21, 2019:</b> It's in your best interest to lend a friend a few of your resources.
								  So open up your wallet, hand over your car keys, or give up some of your free time. What, are you worried that you'll help someone 
								  out and get nothing in return? Well, you might not get any money back, but the goodwill you receive will be a lot more valuable! 
								  People will be ready and waiting to repay the favor and lend you a hand when the time comes.
								  </p>
								</div>
						</div>
						<div class="column "><img class="collapsible" src="images/aquarius.jpg" alt="Aquarius"/>
							   <div class="content">
								  <p><b>DEC 21, 2019:</b> Your impulses can lead you to some wonderful places, but they can also lead you down some very unpleasant paths.
								  So be very mindful of taking direction from your whims today—there are going to be a few situations where you should obey them fully, 
								  but there will also be a few situations where you need to tell them to shut up! You definitely have the wisdom to recognize each situation 
								  as it comes up, so have faith that you will not take a wrong step.
								  </p>
								</div>
						</div>
						<div class="column "><img class="collapsible" src="images/pisces.jpg" alt="Pisces"/>
							   <div class="content">
								  <p><b>DEC 21, 2019:</b> As conversational topics go, politics and religion can be very tricky—so even if you are among friends,
								  be aware that enemies can be created if the wrong comments are made. So try very hard not to inflict your opinions on others today. 
								  Yes, you should say what you feel if you want to, but do not expect everyone else to agree with you. Respecting other people's viewpoints 
								  is a sign that you respect other people.
								  </p>
